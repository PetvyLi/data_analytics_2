The box plot isn't much helpful. Years in service doesn't really affect how much money one get. Male makes more money than females.

Based on the analysis performed above, the conclusions are as follows:

Your Findings here...

Associate Professors make less than Professors. Years in service doesn't seem to affect salary that much. Females make less than males. 

I also discovered that the -

Females make less than males. Meaning that there's still sexism in the workplace. 

Your Findings here...
I need more data such as what major they teach to have a more accurate representation and knowledge of why the data is the way it is.
